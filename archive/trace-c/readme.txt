took 2:30 till 5:54 pm to get first working version. Most of the time was spent learning basic c stuff. Like how do I open & write to files?
How do I create an array at runtime??? what is a malloc? why is there no hashmap??? ok, I'll just come up with some janky thing
using 2 arrays in place of a hashmap. Okay, done but the program just keeps running and won't stop. Fix some performance
issues, bam. Still very slow but it completes and works so guess I'm done. Never want to work with c again.

took 7:15 to
